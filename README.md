# üçÖ Tomato Maturity Detection & Quality Grading üöÄ

A computer vision project that detects tomatoes in images, segments them, and classifies their maturity stage (Ripe, Half-Ripe, Unripe) based on HSV color features.  
The system uses classical image processing techniques including color thresholding, morphological operations, and Hough Circle detection for tomato localization.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Color-Based Classification:** Uses HSV color thresholds to classify tomatoes into maturity stages.
- **Morphological Processing:** Cleans and refines masks with closing/opening operations.
- **Circle Detection:** Detects tomato boundaries using HoughCircles.
- **Automatic Labeling:** Annotates each tomato with its ID and maturity status.
- **Visualization:** Generates and saves multiple intermediate processing steps and final results.
- **Notebook Implementation:** Entire workflow is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`Untitled.ipynb`).
